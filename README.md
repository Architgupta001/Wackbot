# Wackbot
This is Wackbot. He is but a simple Discord bot. But Wackbot needs your help. He wants to become the best Discord bot ever, and in his eyes, that means having the most commands out of any Discord bot in existence. They could be helpful or absolutely useless commands, anything helps. Please join us in making legendary Discord bot history with Wackbot.

## How to add a command to Wackbot

## Use Wackbot in your server
To learn the basics behind Discord bots and how to deploy them, follow the tutorial over at my repository [SuperSimpleBot](https://github.com/IMACULGY/SuperSimpleBot). If you want to use Wackbot, download Wackbot's files instead of SuperSimpleBot's files when the tutorial says to do so.

### Chaos Mode
If you remove the "!" from the `"prefix"` line of `config.json` the bot will no longer require a prefix to be used. In other words, any message sent in your server is scanned by the bot for command phrases ("chaos mode"). You can also change the prefix to the character/phrase of your choice in this manner.

#### DISCLAIMER: The token in the `config.json` file is a placeholder and leads nowhere. To be safe, don't share your access token with others.

It's good to be back.
