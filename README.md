# SuperSimpleBot
The simplest Discord bot you will ever see.
This readme will detail a tutorial to set up this bot for your own, and how to make changes to it!

To further develop your bot from here, use [this tutorial](https://anidiots.guide/)

## Contents
This repository has two files, `config.json` and `index.js`, that are necessary for your bot to run.
* `config.json` holds your bot's token and prefix to call the command. There is a token in the file already, but that MUST be changed!
* `index.js` holds the rest of the bot's code; in this case, what to say when a user enters the command. The command is `!ping`, and the bot will respond `pong!`

## App and Bot Setup
The first thing you should do is create your app on the [Discord developer portal website](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/).
Log in to a Discord account and click on the "Create an application" button to create your app.

You can name your app anything you want, but I named mine "Test Bot App"

Now, you are going to add a bot to your app. Click on the "Bot" tab in the sidebar on the left and then "Add Bot"
