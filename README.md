# Wackbot
This is Wackbot. He is but a simple Discord bot. But Wackbot needs your help. He wants to become the best Discord bot ever, and in his eyes, that means having the most commands out of any Discord bot in existence. They could be helpful or absolutely useless commands, anything helps. Please join us in making legendary Discord bot history with Wackbot.

## How to add a command to Wackbot
We want to make adding commands as easy as possible so more people of different skill levels are willing to contribute. **You don't need programming experience to add a simple command!** All you need to do is follow a simple set of instructions.

If you have the knowledge, feel free to add more complex commands! You can use any (free) API as well.

Before you get started, a few ground rules you must follow to get your command added:
* Follow the indentation of the previous commands. If something is indented improperly or the wrong syntax is used, you will be asked to fix it.
* Make sure the phrase you use for your command is not the same as anyone else's (or it won't work). CTRL+F is your friend
* All commands will be reviewed before being added to Wackbot. Don't be ridiculous.

### First Steps

### Adding the Command

### Submitting the Command to Wackbot

## Use Wackbot in your server
To learn the basics behind Discord bots and how to deploy them, follow the tutorial over at my repository [SuperSimpleBot](https://github.com/IMACULGY/SuperSimpleBot). If you want to use Wackbot, download Wackbot's files instead of SuperSimpleBot's files when the tutorial says to do so.

### Chaos Mode
If you were to remove the "!" from the `"prefix"` line of `config.json` the bot will no longer require a prefix to be used. In other words, any message sent in your server is scanned by the bot for command phrases ("chaos mode"). You can also change the prefix to the character/phrase of your choice in this manner.

## Feedback
Please offer suggestions to make the README better if you have any.

#### DISCLAIMER: The token in the `config.json` file is a placeholder and leads nowhere. To be safe, don't share your access token with others.

It's good to be back.
